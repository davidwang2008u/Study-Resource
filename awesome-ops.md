## Vulnerable Test Targets
It's important to build up knowledge by learning how to break applications left vulnerable by security mistakes.  This section contains a list of vulnerable apps that can be deployed to learn what not to do.  These same apps can be made safe by remediating the intentional vulnerabilities to learn how to prevent attackers from gaining access to underlying infrastructure or data.

# Tools
This collection of tools are useful in establishing a DevSecOps platform.  We have divided the tools into several categories that help with the different divisions of DevSecOps.

## Automation
Automation platforms have an advantage of providing for scripted remediation when security defects are surfaced.

## Testing
Testing is an essential element of a DevSecOps program because it helps to prepare teams for Rugged operations and to determine security defects before they can be exploited.
